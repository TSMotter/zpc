    # xargs is a great command that reads streams of data from standard input, 
    # then generates and executes command lines; meaning it can take output of a 
    # command and passes it as argument of another command. If no command is specified, 
    # xargs executes echo by default. You many also instruct it to read data from a file 
    # instead of stdin.
